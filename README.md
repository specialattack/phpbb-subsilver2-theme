# Subsilver2 theme for phpBB

Current repository version is updated for phpBB version `3.3.0`

## Goal

The goal for this repository is to keep subsilver2 updated for recent phpBB versions to allow [our good old forum](https://forum.specialattack.net/) to keep its former glory.

Additionaly, we have the following goals (when we have the time):
* update the template files and [convert them to Twig syntax](https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?t=2424606)
* update the images to scallable vector graphics for high resolution monitors
* probably more
